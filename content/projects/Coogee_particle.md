### Overview 
- Use AI, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision, approaches to analyse titanium powder samples
- Used in combination with Bayesian optimisaiton to generate useful output.
- Differet from traditional Particle Analysis Methods (DIA, SLS, DLS and Sieve Analysis) oppossed to traditional methods which require physical samples
