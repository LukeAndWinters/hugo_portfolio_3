Multiple drones autonomously patrol a beach, they use a Machine Learning model to detect common beach hazards such as **sharks**, **rip-currents** and **swimmers**. Hazard locations and human Surf-Life-Saver (SLS) input is used in Multi-Agent Control Theory to optimally path the drones based on SLS input - assisting with emergency response and coverage.

Proof-of-concept drone patrol network made in collaboration with the SharkSmart Drone Trial Surf-Life Savers members.

In this video when a shark is detected, it shows the camera in red, and automatically switches to that drones video feed. 

All the drone views are streamed to monitor(s) in the SLS tower, when detections are made it sends an alert, so they can review the appropriate camera, and make decisions based on this information. E.g. A shark is spotted by a patrolling drone, the life-saver can verify this and receive continuosu location updates from the drone.

## High-Level System Overview

**Aims and Objectives:**
1. Develop an autonomous system to patrol Dynamic Envionments for items of interest using CV and multiple UAVs
2. Construct a Proof of Concept using high-fidelity beach simulation for data collection and testing
3. Tailor the output and desired swarm behaviour to the needs of the Australian Surf-Lifesavers 

<img class="slide-img" src="/images/Capstone/Slides/Slide10.png" alt="Slide 10">

Project Used 3 Components:
1. **Simulation:** Proof of Concept Beach Environment
2. **Machine Learningn:** Data Collection and Hazard Detection 
3. **Multi-Agent Control** Theory: Optimal Drone Pathing 
The System allows multiple drones to autonomously patrol a beach, we desigend the ML pipeline to collect training data using a drone sweep to train a custom shark, human and rip detection model. 

The video above shows how the drones patrol behaviour can altered: Either following hazards or exploring based on how the 'importance' sliders are adjusted. 

The model supports up to 5 autonomous drones at the same time, and the behvaiour can be explored by experimenting with the sliders. 

This was implemented so that SLS could tune the design, preferencing hazards they deem more important (e.g. following a shark) or instructing the drone to explore new areas, by manually dropping interest points. 

System intended as an extension to the already in-operation SharkSmart Drone trail in NSW and Queensland to help reduce emergency response time, provide critical information to live-savers and increase their coverage capabilities.

## Multi-Agent Control Highlights

Unique application of tunable *Interest* and *Uncertainty* to influence drone pathing.

<br>

#### Uncertainty
- **Blue - Green:** shows linearly increasing uncertainty function. Drones are driven to explore uncertain areas. The drone FOV (underneath the drone) is 0 Uncertainty. Inversse importance function (further away). Encourages drones to explore the area around itself, that is the least recently seen.

<br>


#### Interest 
- **Red - White:** Particular points drones are driven to explore. (These are created from hazard detections e.g. spotting a shark)

##### *Weighed(Uncertainy) + Weighted(Interest) = Drone Path*
